        <h1>(VACS) | IS Project Management</h1>
        <div class="main-body">
            <p>
                During my participation in the Information Systems (IS) Project Management course, I collaborated with a team to create and implement the Volunteer Activity Coordination System (VACS). This system was developed to enhance volunteer management processes for non-profit organizations. I played a significant role in various aspects of the project, including requirements gathering, system design, project management, and stakeholder communication.
<br><br>
I actively participated in stakeholder interviews and group discussions to gather and assess requirements. Working closely with teammates, I ensured a comprehensive understanding of user needs and preferences. Additionally, I contributed to the design and development of the VACS platform, leveraging coursework and self-directed study to propose innovative ideas and resolve technical challenges.
<br><br>
In terms of project management, I assisted in creating project plans, defining timelines, and allocating tasks. Following Agile principles, I adapted to changing requirements to maintain project momentum. I also engaged with stakeholders, such as classmates and instructors, to gather input and ensure project alignment. Regular participation in group meetings and presentations facilitated progress tracking and feedback collection.
