                Hi, I'm Solomon Jacob, a fourth-year BTM (Business Technology Management) student at TMU (Toronto Metropolitan University). I'm passionate about soccer and play on the Ajax OSL men's team. I also have a love for music and play the drums at church. These activities allow me to balance my academic life with my interests, and I find joy in both sports and music.Alongside my interest in soccer and music,  I'm fascinated by the ever-evolving world of IT and strive to stay updated with the latest trends and technologies. Whether I'm exploring new software developments, coding languages, or learning about the latest tech innovations, my enthusiasm for IT is unwavering.
