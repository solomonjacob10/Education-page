                At the Ministry of Public and Business Service Delivery, within Infrastructure Technology Services - Customer relationship Management (CRM), I actively contributed to project management under the guidance of Senior Business Analysts, Project Managers, and Customer Account Managers. My responsibilities included creating timelines, managing budgets, and ensuring successful project recovery. This hands-on experience enabled me to align technology initiatives seamlessly with organizational objectives. Additionally, exposure to server configurations, cybersecurity tasks, and data management honed my expertise in infrastructure management, network connectivity, and essential cybersecurity protocols. I leveraged tools like Power BI for data interpretation, contributing to informed decision-making and ensuring the viability of proposed solutions.

                My  experience as a Projects Assistant in the OPS Summer Employment Opportunities Program deeply resonates with the impactful work conducted by dedicated professionals within the OPS community. Witnessing their commitment to innovation, diversity, and inclusivity fueled my desire to further deepen my understanding of public service operations.
