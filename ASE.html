                As an Administrative Assistant, I was responsible for documenting the requirements of the electrical contractors using Power BI and Excel. I designed roadmaps outlining key milestones, timelines, and resource allocations using the documented requirements. These served as a guide for streamlining the workflow of electrical contractors during various projects. I also created roadmaps highlighting the adoption of new technologies within the company, outlining the implementation of advanced lighting systems, energy-efficient solutions, or innovative electrical equipment.
                <br><br>
Furthermore, I explored cutting-edge LED lighting technologies by researching solutions tailored to our electrical contractor environment. 
This research involved delving into the latest advancements in smart lighting systems that could enhance energy efficiency and provide customizable lighting solutions for diverse project needs. 
These research initiatives were integral to proposing effective solutions, ensuring that the adoption of new technologies aligned seamlessly with the expertise and goals of the electrical contractors at All Stream Electric.
