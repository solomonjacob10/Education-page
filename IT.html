                One example of a project that honed my analytical skills in IT Infrastructure focused on translating diverse business needs into effective IT solutions. Using Microsoft Visio, I crafted network designs, considering factors such as device numbers, connectivity devices, and network topology. These designs involved optimizing connectivity by implementing tailored LAN solutions for each floor and location, utilizing star topologies, fibre optic backbone cables, and wireless technologies. Additionally, the project involved the seamless integration of DHCP servers for automated IP address allocation, secure remote connectivity through an IPsec-based VPN, and implementation of VoIP solutions. To secure web and email services, servers, including VPN, were placed in a DMZ area connected to the internet through a firewall.
